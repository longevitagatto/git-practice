Kawasaki was born in Aira, a town in central Kagoshima Prefecture in the south of Japan.
He began playing baseball after his older brother got him into the sport.
Though he was a pitcher throughout his early years,
Kawasaki switched to shortstop after enrolling in Kagoshima Prefectural Technical High School.
